## 🚀 Activation Guide (GitHub Pages)

To make the website "directly open" from this folder:

1.  **Clear your Repository:** Delete everything currently in your `Divyansh_pbl2` repo.
2.  **Upload the Contents:** Drag everything from inside the `FINAL_SYSTEMATIC_MOODWATCH` folder into your repo.
    - *Ensure `.github`, `frontend`, `backend`, and `ai` are all at the top level.*
3.  **Flip the Switch:**
    - Go to **Settings** → **Pages**.
    - Change **Source** to **"GitHub Actions"**.

**The app will be live at:** 👉 `https://divyansh598.github.io/Divyansh_pbl2/`
